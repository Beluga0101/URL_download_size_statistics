# URL Size Checker

A Python script to check the size of files specified in a list of URLs. It first attempts to retrieve the size using HEAD requests and, if that fails, downloads the file to determine its size.

## Features

- HEAD request to check file size without downloading the entire file.
- Fallback to GET request if HEAD request does not provide the `Content-Length`.
- Respects `Retry-After` header for rate limiting.
- Random delay between requests to avoid triggering rate limits.

## Installation

To use this script, you need Python installed on your system. You can download the script and run it locally.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
